# Maximum lifespan estimation via Leukocyte Telomere Length (LTL)

This repository is about a project i worked on for the Statistics course in my first year of bachelor.

The original objective for the project was to estimate the maximum lifespan of a biological human being using existent datasets on mortality (such ad the IDL).
We instead thought about reframing the problem by investigating the fundamental reasons that cause life to decay, which we identified mainly in the shortening of telomere length.

After an extensive literature research on the matter, we identified the Telomere Length computed from peripherical blood Leukocyte cells as the most used telomer aging biomarker, and we thus decided to proceed with that.
To gather the data needed for the analysis we contacted the University of Calabria and obtained access to a dataset containing longitudinal and cross sectional data about LTL through different age and sex groups.
